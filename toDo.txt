For the starting point, starter.py, you should submit a version in which you have (at least) these methods:

    __repr__(self): should generate a string containing all of the dictionaries in the text model, in full—for testing and checking how they are working. Feel free to add more.
        Actually, this __repr__ is already provided, returning the dictionaries in string form, along with the first 42 characters of self.text and self.cleanedtext.    Be sure to look over what's provided below. X

    makeSentenceLengths(self): should use the text in self.text to create the self.sentencelengths dictionary. An incomplete version is already present. (Again, details below.) X

    cleanString(self, s): should accept a string s and return a revised string with no punctuation and no upper-case letters. Again, an incomplete version is present. X

    Beyond the above progress in starter.py, also create a starter.txt that includes a short (3-4 sentence) starting idea of the source texts you might use for this project's comparisons (and the names of all of your team members!).

    Submit that in the appropriate Gradescope spot with both starter.py and starter.txt





For the milestone, you should submit (on Gradescope) a version for which the following pieces are implemented and work:

    X makeWordLengths(self): should use the text in self.text to create the self.wordlengths dictionary.

    X makeWords(self): should use the text in self.text to create the self.words dictionary.

    X makeStems(self): should use the text in self.text to create the self.stems dictionary.

    makeMyParameter(s): should use the text in self.text to create the myparameter dictionary. This one is up to you (we used punctuation—feel free to use that or something else...!)
        This "other feature" isn't needed for the milestone, but it is needed for the final version. Note that you should choose a better name than myparameter!

    Be sure to have a milestone.txt that includes a short (3-4 sentence) reflection on how the project has gone so far (and what still remains, if anything!).
