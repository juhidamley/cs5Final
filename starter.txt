Haruki Murakami is a popular Japanese writer whose works have been published into countless English editions, some with different translators. Given the linguistic distance between Japanese and English, I am curious to see if the computer could distinguish between the different translations. I plan on comparing the Jay Rubin and Alfred Birnbaum translations of the novel Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World.
